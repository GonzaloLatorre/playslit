    <h1>STUPID</h1>
    <div  id="cajas" class="stupid">
        <p>
            I'm stupid<br>
            I'll build a rocket for you<br>
            I'm losing all my self respect<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm wasted<br>
            I've had no alcohol and<br>
            I'll tell you now I haven't slept<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I passed time debating why you’d even wanna be with me in the first place<br>
            I’d hate to sigh but paint won’t dry<br>
            So buddy let’s pick up the pace<br>
        </p>
        <p>    
            Calm me down for the thousandth time<br>
            But I still won’t hear what you say<br>
            Love's not blind and that’s a crime<br>
            So just say it to my face<br>
            Put me in my place<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes its toll and breaks my soul<br>
            And my mind just won’t leave me<br>
            Alone I’d agree that it’s all just me<br>
            So just don’t pick up the phone<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
            That hasn't happened to you yet<br>
        </p>
        <p>    
            I'm useless<br>
            I haven’t showered in a bit<br>
            I wasn’t cut out for this shit<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm clueless<br>
            I doubt myself just for the hit<br>
            I wasn’t cut out for this shit<br>
            I might need to quit<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes its toll and breaks my soul<br>
            And my mind just won’t leave me<br>
            Alone I’d agree that it’s all just me<br>
            So just don’t pick up the phone<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            God, I'm going home<br>
            Fuck, I'm going home<br>
            That hasn’t happened to you yet <br>
