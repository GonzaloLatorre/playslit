            So she said what's the problem baby <br>
            What's the problem I don't know<br>
            Well maybe I'm in love (love)<br>
            Think about it every time<br>
            I think about it<br>
            <br>
            Can't stop thinking 'bout it<br>
            How much longer will it take to cure this<br>
            Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)<br>
            Makes me want to turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love<br>
            <br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Turn a little faster<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            The world will follow after<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            'Cause everybody's after love<br>
            <br>
            So I said I'm a snowball running<br>
            Running down into the spring that's coming all this love<br>
            Melting under blue skies<br>
            Belting out sunlight<br>
            Shimmering love<br>
            <br>
            Well baby I surrender<br>
            To the strawberry ice cream<br>
            Never ever end of all this love<br>
            Well I didn't mean to do it<br>
            But there's no escaping your love<br>
            <br>
            These lines of lightning<br>
            Mean we're never alone,<br>
            Never alone, no, no<br>
            <br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Move a little closer<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            I want to hear you whisper<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Settle down inside my love<br>
            <br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Jump a little higher<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            If you feel a little lighter<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            We were once upon a time in love<br>
            <br>
            We're accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            <br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            Accidentally in love<br>
            <br>
            Accidentally<br>
            <br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            Accidentally<br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            I'm in love, I'm in love,<br>
            Accidentally<br>
            <br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Spin a little tighter<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            And the world's a little brighter<br>
            Come on, come on<br>
            Just get yourself inside her<br>
            <br>
            Love I'm in love <br>
