    <h1>The Anthem</h1>
    <div  id="cajas" class="anthem">
        <p>
            Yeah<br>
            Here we go<br>
            <br>
            It's a new day<br>
            But it all feels old<br>
            It's a good life<br>
            That's what I'm told<br>
            But everything, it all just feels the same<br>
            At my high school<br>
            It felt more to me<br>
            Like a jail cell<br>
            A penitentiary<br>
            My time spent there, it only made me see<br>
            <br>
            That I don't ever wanna be like you<br>
            I don't wanna do the things you do<br>
            I'm never gonna hear the words you say<br>
            And I don't ever wanna<br>
            <br>
            I don't ever wanna be you<br>
            Don't wanna be just like you<br>
            Oh, what I'm saying is<br>
            This is the anthem<br>
            Throw all your hands up<br>
            You<br>
            Don't wanna be you<br>
            <br>
            Go to college<br>
            Or university<br>
            Get a real job<br>
            That's what they said to me<br>
            But I could never live the way they want<br>
            I'm gonna get by<br>
            And just do my time<br>
            Outta step while<br>
            They all get in line<br>
            I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind<br>
            <br>
            Do you really wanna be like them?<br>
            Do you really wanna be another trend?<br>
            Do you wanna be part of that crowd?<br>
            'Cause I don't ever wanna<br>
            <br>
            I don't ever wanna be you<br>
            Don't wanna be just like you<br>
            Oh, what I'm saying is<br>
            This is the anthem<br>
            Throw all your hands up<br>
            You<br>
            Don't wanna be you<br>
            <br>
            You shake it once, that's fine<br>
            You shake it twice, that's okay<br>
            You shake it three times<br>
            You're playing with yourself again<br>
            <br>
            You<br>
            Don't wanna be just like you<br>
            What I'm saying is<br>
            This is the anthem<br>
            Throw all your hands up<br>
            Y'all got to feel me<br>
            Sing if you're with me<br>
            You<br>
            Don't wanna be just like you<br>
            (Be just like you)<br>
            This is the anthem<br>
            Throw all your hands up<br>
            Y'all got to feel me<br>
            Sing if you're with me<br>
            <br>
            Another loser anthem<br>
            (Whoa-oh)<br>
            Another loser anthem<br>
            (Whoa-oh)<br>
            Another loser anthem<br>
            (Whoa-oh)<br>
            Another loser anthem<br>
