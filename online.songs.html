            Josie, you're my<br>
            Source of most frustration<br>
            Forget when I<br>
            Don't meet expectations<br>
            Everything you wished came true<br>
            In the end we all blamed you<br>
            Even though, as they all know you weren't the only one, two, three, four<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do you still keep it around<br>
            When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything<br>
            And I know that you dated other guys<br>
            But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me (shit!)<br>
            Why am I still hanging around<br>
            When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And you are getting rides home in his car<br>
            You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything<br>
            Please don't remind me, put your past behind me<br>
            It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end<br>
            And I am not fine, last night I saw you online<br>
            Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if we can have another day<br>
            I've got so much left to say, I'd tell you everything<br>
            And I'll laugh when I think about the past<br>
            When I see you after class, you're hating everything<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please don't remind me, put your past behind me<br>
            It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end<br>
            And I am not fine, last night I saw you online<br>
            Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please don't remind me, put your past behind me<br>
            It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end<br>
            And I am not fine, last night I saw you online<br>
            Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And she said, (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)<br>
            "I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)<br>
            "I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)<br>
            "I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)<br>
